<h1>Exhibition Hall</h1>
This is my final project from the EPAM Java course. 

The main part of the project is clean Java Core. Here is demonstrated my knowledge of JSP/Servlets technologies 
and Collections Framework. Pages are generated on server side in the form of JSP with the help of JSTL.
Here you can see the work with files, their uploading to the server and sending from server side to the client (images of expositions).
I also worked with PDFBox library to make auto-mailing the tickets and special offers. 

Frontend was made with the help of Bootstrap, but some styles were changed to be more unique. I used a SASS-compiler
for generating CSS-files. That's made the structure of styles more clear.
